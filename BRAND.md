# Alexis Garden — Brand Guide

## What is Alexis Garden?

**alexis.garden** is the umbrella for all of Alexis's personal projects and client portfolio work. It's both a personal brand and a living portfolio — a place where strategy work, photography, writing, and experiences all grow together.

Think of it as the garden where everything Alexis cultivates lives: client projects, personal experiments, writing, and creative ventures.
